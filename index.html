        <p style="padding:30px; background-color:#FFEBCD;"><span> To make a filling,
          finely chop red onion, cabbage,
        spring onions and cilantro. Place those chopped veggies
        in a large bowl. Add ground chicken on the same bowl.
        Add ginger paste, garlic paste, salt (as per your taste),
    cumin powder, coriander powder and momo masala powder
        (this can be easily found in any Nepali/Indian Store).
        Add melted butter and warm water. Mixed those ingredients
        together. Now, after the filling is ready, start adding
        those filling in each wrapper (wrapper can be found in any
      chinese/korean store). Momos can be wrapped in different
        ways. We just need to make sure the filling is properly
        closed in the wrapper.</span>
      <br/></br>
        <span>After all fillings are wrapped, place the momo on the top
    two shelves of the steamer. Add as much momos as the
       steamer can fit, but make sure that each momo is one inch
        apart so that they don't stick to one another
        Now, boil water in a bottom shelf of the steamer. After
        he water is boiled, add the remaining shelves(containing
        momos) to the steamer. Steam those momos for about 15 mins. </span>
      </br></br>
        <span>While the momo is steaming, you can start making the
          sauce. In a pan, add two tablespoon oil. After the oil is
        heated, add cumin seeds and fry them until its golden brown
        in color. Add dry chillies (you can add chillies
        according your preference). After the chillies are
        slightly roasted, add chopped tomatoes and salt per taste.
        Cook the tomatoes until they are soft. After the tomatoes
        are cooked, add sugar to balance the taste. Then, remove
        the pan from heat. Now, add freshly chopped cilantro
      and one small sized lemon. Blend everything in a blender
        until they are smooth. The sauce is ready as well
        as the Momo. Serve the momo with the sauce. Enjoy!! <a href="https://www.stunningnepal.com/nepalese-food/" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about Nepalese Foods</a></span></p>
